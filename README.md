# ðŸ§© Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains all my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice code** in a single file.  
It includes:  
- âœ… Implementations of common **data structures**  
- âœ… Problems solved during my **University Labs**  
- âœ… Extra problems I solve on a **weekly basis from LeetCode**
